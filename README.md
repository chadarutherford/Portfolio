## Apps

## Cloud Wish List
Cloud Wish List is an app I created to allow users to create a wishlist of items they search for on the Walmart product search API. It shows the item's image, description, price, and whether or not it is available online. Once the item is saved to the wish list, it is stored in a CoreData backend, and also synchronized to CloudKit, allowing the user not only to persist their wishlists but also if they should decide to delete the app, upon re-install, it allows them to retrieve their previously saved lists.

## Daily Dose
As a requirement for Lamda School's Unit 1 Build Week, along with another team member (Tyler Christian) , we designed this pill reminder app that enables the user to save a list of their daily medications. These medications are being persisted to a Property List inside the app's documents directory. Upon reloading of the main TableView, the app schedules local notifications to fire when the user is due to take their daily medications. It also schedules another notification to fire when their dosage is at or below 10 doses.
